      <p>Start your morning off wit this lovely song by Bill Withers. It's helped me to wake up in the morning and get my fat arse out of bed, so I'd highly recommend listening to it in the morning. Fun fact: The song is notable for Withers' sustained note towards the end, which at 18 seconds long, is one of the longest ever recorded on a song.</p>

 <p>Now, this song has an interesting history. Originally it was a song by a Neue Deutsche Welle (New German Wave) band called Falco, sung in German. The song was then covered by this band, After The Fire. When the sing "Zwei, drei, vier, one, two, three," they essentially just flipped it around, as the German version spoke English first, then German. Oh, and did I mention that the song's about drug-running cocain behind the police's watchful eye?</p>

 <p>This song, by former <i>Genesis</i> member Peter Gabriel, was released on MTV (for you 80's kids out there) on April 25, 1986, became MTV's number one music video of all time. I mean, just look at it!</p>
 
 <p>Gabriel lay under a sheet of glass for 16 hours while filming the video one frame at a time. "It took a lot of hard work," Gabriel recalled. "I was thinking at the time, 'If anyone wants to try and copy this video, good luck to them.'" Two dead, headless, featherless chickens were animated using stop-motion and shown dancing along to the synthesised shakuhachi solo in the middle of the song. This section was animated by Nick Park, of Aardman Animations (creators of the popular <i>Wallace & Gromit</i> stop-motion films), who was refining his work in plasticine animation at the time. The video ended with a large group of extras jerkily rotating around Gabriel, among them his daughters Anna-Marie and Melanie, the animators themselves and director Stephen Johnson's girlfriend. Also included were six women who posed as the back-up singers of the song. Did I also mention that the song's an innuendo for his...er...well, his Sledgehammer, <i>if you know what I mean.</i></p>

<p><i>"That’s All"</i> is a lover’s lament about being ignored and beaten down by an unreceptive partner; despite the despairing tone it’s got a bright sing-along melody that makes the song less depressing than it probably needed to be." - Patrick Bateman, <i>Amercian Psycho</i></p>

 <p>"On a trip to St. Croix in 1969, I was the first victim of a vicious St. Croix gang who eventually murdered 8 American tourists. At that time, I suffered multiple facial fractures and wounds and was left for dead. While I was recovering, I wrote "Dancin In The Moonlight" in which I envisioned an alternate reality, the dream of a peaceful and joyful celebration of life. The song became a huge hit and was recorded by many musicians worldwide. "Dancin In The Moonlight" continues to be popular to this day."
 - From Sherman Kelly's website, talking about the origin of this song</p>

 <p>I'm a sentimental bastard, just to get it across the board, and this song by Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons really hits me in the feels. This song makes me happy even though I'm not in a relationship. And with that, I leave with you beautiful and catchy song to enjoy your day with. <i>Au revoir.</i></p>
